            <div class="faq-body">
                <p>In the process of purchasing a home, the initial and crucial step usually involves obtaining
                    pre-approval for a mortgage. By securing pre-approval, you gain valuable insights into the
                    price range that aligns with what you can afford, enabling you to make informed decisions
                    during your home search. This essential step sets the foundation for a smooth and successful
                    home-buying journey, empowering you with the confidence to explore properties within your
                    pre-approved budget.

                <p>The amount of money you need as a down payment can vary depending on several

                and the lender's requirements. The average downpayment is currently between 3% and 5%. For special 
                instances, such as a VA or USDA loan, you aren't required to put any money down.

            <div class="faq-body">
                <p> Homes can sell within days or weeks in a fast-moving market or may take several months in 
                    a slower market. On average, it's common for homes to stay on the market for 30 to 60 days, 
                    but this can vary significantly depending on factors, such as price, home condition, seasonality,
                    and location. Consulting a real estate agent is crucial in providing more specific insights into 
                    the current market conditions in your area and give you a better estimate based on your home's 
                    characteristics.

            <!-- faq answer -->
            <div class="faq-body">
                <p>When selling your home, it is essential to be transparent and disclose any information that could 
                potentially affect the buyer's decision or the property's value. Full disclosure not only builds trust 
                but also helps you comply with legal requirements. Real estate disclosure laws vary from one jurisdiction 
                to another, so it's crucial to understand the specific requirements in your area. In some places, sellers 
                are required to provide a formal disclosure statement, while in others, it might be more informal. Matthew 
                Schlieman will guide you through the potential factors for disclosure and ensure you keep buyers in the know.

            <!-- faq answer -->
            <div class="faq-body">
                <p> Deciding whether to hold an open house when selling your home can be a strategic decision, and 
                    there are both advantages and disadvantages to consider. The decision to hold an open house 
                    depends on your specific situation, the local real estate market conditions, and your comfort 
                    level with the process. Many sellers choose to have at least one open house during their listing 
                    period to test the market and attract potential buyers. If you decide to hold an open house, work 
                    closely with your real estate agent to ensure proper planning, security measures, and effective 
                    marketing to maximize its benefits.
